1. Introduction

    The goal of the R-Type project is to create the classic R-Type game
    with an online multiplayer.

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
    this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2. R-Type architecture

    R-Type is build like a classic server-client game. The game runs 
    in the server and the client has to connect to the server. 
    The connection works through an UDP protocol.

3. R-Type UDP Protocol

    The client and server communicate through during the game with the 
    UDP protocol.

    3.1. Commands

        Every command must follow following structure:

            int ACTION_ID;
            ActionType ACTION_TYPE,
            int ID;
            // followed by ACTION_TYPE dependant data

        Where ACTION_ID is an integer that increases with every command, 
        ACTION_TYPE is an element of the ActionType enumeration
        (described below), the ID is the identifier of an entity
        (e.g.: Player, Enemy or Projectile). The remaining part of 
        the command is dependant of the ACTION_TYPE.

        The ActionType enumeration:

            enum ActionType {
                START, 
                RESTART,
                UP,       
                DOWN,     
                LEFT,     
                RIGHT,    
                POS,    
                SHOOT, 
                CREATE, 
                INCREASE,
                COLLISION,          
                DAMAGE,             
                DESTROY,            
                DEAD,             
                END,                
                JOINLOBBY,          
                CREATELOBBY,
                LEAVELOBBY,         
                JOINSUCCESSFULL,    
                CREATESUCCESSFULL,
                ERROR,
            };

        The excact structure of the commands are explained throughout
        the document.

    3.2. Server connection

        When the server is running it waits for a client to connect.
        The client has two options: create a lobby or join a lobby.

        In case the client chooses to create a lobby the client must 
        send following command: 

            ACTION_ID;CREATELOBBY;ACTION_TYPE_ID;LOBBY_IP;PLAYERNAME;

        Now the server waits for a second connection. When a second 
        player wants to join a lobby the client must send following
        command:

            ACTION_ID;JOINLOBBY;ACTION_TYPE_ID;LOBBY_IP;PLAYERNAME;

        If the connection is successful the server sends back following
        command:

       ACTION_ID;JOINSUCCESSFULL;ACTION_TYPE_ID;PLAYERNAME1;PLAYERNAME2;

       Once both player are connected the players can press the start 
       button and have to send the start command:

            ACTION_ID;START;PORT_NB;CURRENT_PLAYER_ID;

        It listens for a command containing:

            ACTION_ID = 0
            ACTION_TYPE = START
            PORT_NB = port the client is running on

        On success the server response with command to
        create the player:

            ACTION_ID = 1
            ACTION_TYPE = CREATE
            ID = id of entity
            TYPE = PLAYER (0)
            X = x coordinate of player
            Y = y coordinate of player
            SPRITE_PATH = path to player sprite

    3.3 Game start 

        Once the game is running the client sends the player input or 
        an end command to the server. 
        The following ACTION_TYPES are possible:

            enum ActionType {
                UP,
                DOWN,
                LEFT,
                RIGHT,
                SHOOT,
                END,
            };

        For the player movement the command has the same structure:

            ACTION_ID = automatic generated value 
            ACTION_TYPE = UP / DOWN / LEFT / RIGHT
            ID = id of the player
            USER_TRIGGERED = TRUE (bool)

        The server answers with the new position of the player:

            ACTION_ID = automatic generated value
            ACTION_TYPE = POS
            ID = id of the player
            X = new x coordinate of the player
            Y = new y coordinate of the player 

        The SHOOT command follows following structure:

            ACTION_ID = automatic generated value
            ACTION_TYPE = SHOOT
            ID = id of the player
            USER_TRIGGERED = TRUE (bool)
            DAMAGE = amount of damage based on load time
            TYPE = 1, 2, ... (what kind of bullet gets shot)

        The server answers with another CREATE command:

            ACTION_ID = automatic generated value
            ACTION_TYPE = CREATE
            ID = id of the the bullet
            TYPE = BULLET (2)
            X = x coordinate of bullet
            Y = y coordinate of bullet

        If the client window gets closed the client sends a command that
        disconnects the server and the client:

            ACTION_ID = automatic generated value
            ACTION_TYPE = END
            PORT_NB = port the client is running in
